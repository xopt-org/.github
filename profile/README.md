Xopt-org is an organization that collects a set of tools to work with the Xopt optimization library, a general purpose library for connecting advanced optimization algorithms to arbitrary problems. The Xopt library is an open-source optimization toolkit designed to solve complex optimization problems. It leverages a variety of algorithms and methods, including Bayesian optimization and evolutionary strategies, to handle high-dimensional, multi-objective, and computationally expensive tasks. The library is particularly useful in scientific and engineering domains where optimization is critical, such as design optimization, parameter tuning, and experimental design. While the package is agnostic to the type of problem being solved, most of the development is motivated by solving scientific optimization and expreiment control problems, particularly in the field of particle accelerator physics.

The ways of interacting with Xopt are shown below.
